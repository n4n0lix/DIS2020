\section*{3.1 Isolation Levels and SQL}
\subsection*{a)}
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{How can you determine the currently set isolation level?}\\
	The default isolation level of a database is configured inside the \texttt{postgresql.conf} with the attribute \texttt{default\_transaction\_isolation}. It can be queried via \texttt{SHOW default\_transaction\_isolation}.
	
	\item \textbf{What is the default isolation level of PostgreSQL?}\\
	The default isolation level of PostgreSQL is \texttt{read committed}.
		
	\item \textbf{How can the isolation level be changed during a session in PostgreSQL?}\\
	\texttt{SET SESSION CHARACTERISTICS AS TRANSACTION \{ SERIALIZABLE | REPEATABLE READ | READ COMMITTED | READ UNCOMMITTED \}}
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{b)}
\begin{lstlisting}
create table OPK (
  ID   int4,
  NAME varchar(64)
)
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection*{c)}
\begin{lstlisting}
insert into OPK (ID, NAME) 	VALUES (1, 'shaggy'), (2, 'fred'), 	(3, 'velma'), (4, 'scooby'), (5, 'daphne');
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection*{d)}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Discuss what locks you would expect are held at this point (and before a commit) with \texttt{Read Committed}?}\\
We would expect 1 table lock and 1 row lock to be hold before and 0 table locks and 0 row locks to be hold after the commit. \texttt{Cursor Stability (Read Committed)} never holds more than 1 row lock.

\item \textbf{Discuss what locks you would expect are held at this point (and before a commit) with \texttt{Repeatable Read}?}\\
We would expect 1 table lock to be hold before and 0 locks after the commit. \texttt{Repeatable Read} locks the complete table until commit.
\end{itemize}

\section*{3.2 Lock Conflicts}
\subsection*{a)}
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{What happens? What is the output of Connection 1?}\\
	The output of Connection 1 is
	\begin{lstlisting}
	(4, 'scooby')
	(5, 'daphne')
	\end{lstlisting}
	\item \textbf{Compare the state before the transactions with the state after the transactions.}\\
	After the transactions, one new row has been added to the OPK table.
	\item \textbf{What can be observed if Connection 1 commits and execute its SQL command again?}\\
	The output of Connection 1 then becomes
	\begin{lstlisting}
	(4, 'scooby')
	(5, 'daphne')
	(6, 'scrappy')
	\end{lstlisting}
	\item \textbf{Can we observe a Canonical Synchronization Problem? If yes, explain which one and why it appears.}\\
	We cannot observe any canonical synchronization problems.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{b)}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \textbf{What happens? What is the output of Connection 1?}\\
	The output of Connection 1 is
	\begin{lstlisting}
	(4, 'scooby')
	(5, 'daphne')
	\end{lstlisting}
	\item \textbf{Compare the state before the transactions with the state after the transactions.}\\
	After the transactions, one new row has been added to the OPK table.
	\item \textbf{What can be observed if Connection 1 commits and execute its SQL command again?}\\
	The output of Connection 1 then becomes
	\begin{lstlisting}
	(4, 'scooby')
	(5, 'daphne')
	(6, 'scrappy')
	\end{lstlisting}
	\item \textbf{Can we observe a Canonical Synchronization Problem? If yes, explain which one and why it appears.}\\
	We cannot observe any canonical synchronization problems.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{c)}
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{In this scenario Connection 2 has to wait until Connection 1 commits. Explain why.}\\
	The \texttt{Serializable} isolation level ensures a serial execution of transactions, therefor Connection 1 has to be finished before Connection 2 can continue.
	\item \textbf{Discuss, what lock can be potentially encountered on the table OPK? Which Connection do the locks belong to?}\\
	Connection 1 is likely to hold an R lock on the table.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{d)}
\begin{lstlisting}
create table MPK (
	id int4,
	name varchar(64),
	CONSTRAINT mpk_pk PRIMARY KEY (id)
);

insert into MPK (ID, NAME) 
	VALUES (1, 'shaggy'), (2, 'fred'), 
	(3, 'velma'), (4, 'scooby'), (5, 'daphne');
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection*{e)}
We observed the exact same behaviour as for \textit{c)}.
